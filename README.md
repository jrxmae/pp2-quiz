* It is possible to learn new information about the gods and goddesses that you have not come across before.
* The website is reponsive and will acommodate a screen as small as a phone and as large as a desktop.
* The quiz contains clear questions with three options to choose as an answer.
* The score will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
* There is a retry button at the end of the quiz where the user can do the quiz again to correctly choose what they did not before or just for fun.
* There is a feedback button that will allow the user to leave comments on how to improve, what questions they would like to see,etc.


### Color Scheme
* The background is an orange/pink/purple sky at sunset to portray high above the sky where gods may roam, with a lighter opacity so that the quiz may be more legible to the user.
* The container of the quiz is grey stone pillars connected that resemble the temples in Greece.
* The color of the text is black to stand out from the container.
