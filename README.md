## User Experience (UX)

### User Goals

* The goal is to test your knowledge on the gods and goddesses of Greek Mythology and maybe learn along the way.

### User Expectations

* The instructions, questions and option for answers is legible to the user.
* It is easy to navigate through the instructions, quiz, retrying and leaving feedback.
* It is possible to learn new information about the gods and goddesses that you have not come across before.
* The website is reponsive and will acommodate a screen as small as a phone and as large as a desktop.
* The quiz contains clear questions with three options to choose as an answer.
* The score will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
* There is a retry button at the end of the quiz where the user can do the quiz again to correctly choose what they did not before or just for fun.
* There is a feedback button that will allow the user to leave comments on how to improve, what questions they would like to see,etc.


### Color Scheme
* The background is an orange/pink/purple sky at sunset to portray high above the sky where gods may roam, with a lighter opacity so that the quiz may be more legible to the user.
* The container of the quiz is grey stone pillars connected that resemble the temples in Greece.
* The color of the text is black to stand out from the container.

## Main Page

### Features

#### One Page

- There is only one page, the user navigates through buttons and clicking on options for answers.
- The page starts off with showing the user the instructions for the quiz along with a challenge button underneath that will start the quiz.
- Once the challenge button is pressed, the quiz starts off with the first question.
- When the user has chosen an answer by clicking on one of the three options given, it will immediately go to the next question until all ten questions have been answered.
- After all of the questions have been answered, the total score the user got correct out of ten questions will appear along with a retry button and a feedback button.
- When the retry button is clicked, the user can redo the quiz all over again.
- There is also a feedback button where the user can leave comment on how to improve the quiz or what kind of questions they would like to see.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import specific fonts that would style the quiz better.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) Developer Tools were used to experiment and test site responsiveness.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository where all of the commits were pushed to.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write, edit and test the code.
- [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML file.
- [Jigsaw validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) was used to validate the CSS style file.
- [Jshint validation](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the script file.
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/#google_vignette/) was where I generated the necessary files from what I downloaded from Icons8.
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/fire/) was where I found the fire favicon for the website.
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) was where I found the images for the background and container of the quiz.
- [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive/) is what I used for the mockup images of the website.

## Testing 

## Bugs
- There was a problem with the retry button. I had it set to hidden from the start and to show up when results are displayed. However, it did the complete opposite and showed up the whole time and disappeared when results were show. Got rid of this bug by removing the button for retry inside the div with id of 'results'. I put it under the div instead but still within the div container.

## Deployment

Gitpod and Github were used to do the following:
- Create a new repository with GitHub using the template from Code Institute for Gitpod.
- Click on the settings at the menu tab.
- Locate the 'Pages' tab once you are in.
- Find 'Source' and make sure you have 'Deploy from a branch' selected. Underneath 'Branch', make sure to change from 'none' to 'main' and that it is set to '/root' beside it.
- Go back to the code page of your repository and a website link should generate at the top of the page after a few minutes.

## Acknowledgement
### Code
- The template to use for Gitpod came from Code Institute.
- Stack Overflow and W3Schools helped me to better understand my code and fix it when there were bugs.
- For the ReadME file, I used my last project as reference as well as a project my mentor sent me as an example [Quiz on coagulation in water treatment](http://un-ihe.org/).
- Thank you to my mentor Marcel for his constant support throughout my course.

### Content
- Questions were made solely by me using information gathered from [The Greek Gods and Goddesses](https://www.twinkl.ie/blog/the-greek-gods-and-goddesses-facts-for-kids), [The Greek Gods](https://learningmole.com/the-greek-gods-5-fun-facts-about-the-greek-gods/) and [Gods, Goddesses and Greek Mythology](https://www.britannica.com/list/12-greek-gods-and-goddesses) as well as my own knowledge.
